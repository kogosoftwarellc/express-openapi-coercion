> Express middleware to coerce request properties according to an openapi parameter list.

## Highlights

* Effortlessly coerce header, path, query and formData request properties to defined types in
an openapi parameters list.
* Handles array types.
* Performant.
* Extensively tested.
* Small footprint.
* Currently supports openapi 2.0 (a.k.a. swagger 2.0) parameter lists.
* Supports _collectionFormat_ for _formData array_ parameters.

## Example

See `./test/data-driven/*.js` for more examples.

```javascript
var app = require('express')();
var coerce = require('express-openapi-coercion')({
  parameters: [
    {
      in: 'query',
      type: 'integer',
      name: 'foo',
      required: true
    }
  ]
});

app.get('/something', coerce, function(req, res) {
  // GET /something?foo=5
  console.log(req.query.foo); //=> 5
});
```

## API

#### args.parameters
